these detailed out steps explains session cookie mgt

1.
when i do req.session.userId = user.id , what I am doing is saving userId property on req.session object. and this session object is then saved to redis as a key:value pair. the key is generated automatically.

e.g of how it is stored in redis
sess:ajkdikjdsmnsdmnsd -> {userId:1}

express-session will set a cookie on my browser: this cookie is a signed version of key that the redis stores the session object in. signed with the secret key we specified in the browser

now when a user makes a request, this signed cookie that has been set on the browser is going to be sent to the server

on the server, the signed key is unsigned using the same secret key we specified in the config file
to decrypt the key which will result to sess:ajkdikjdsmnsdmnsd and using that key, the server makes a request to redis using that decrypted key to retrieve the stored value and stores it on req.session object
